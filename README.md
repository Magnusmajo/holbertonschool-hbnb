HBnB project for Holberton School

## Project Setup Overview

HBnB is a comprehensive web application project developed as part of the curriculum at Holberton School. The project aims to build a full-stack clone of the popular web application Airbnb. It involves various aspects of software engineering, including backend development, frontend development, and database management.

### Key Components of HBnB

1. **Backend**: The backend is built using Python and the Flask web framework. It handles all the server-side logic, including user authentication, data processing, and API endpoints.

2. **Frontend**: The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the application, including searching for listings, booking accommodations, and managing user profiles.

3. **Database**: The application uses a MySQL database to store all the data related to users, listings, bookings, and reviews. SQLAlchemy is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to interact with the database.

4. **Deployment**: The project is deployed using various tools and platforms, such as Docker for containerization, Nginx for web server management, and AWS for cloud hosting.

### Learning Outcomes

By working on the HBnB project, we have gained hands-on experience in:

- Designing and implementing RESTful APIs
- Integrating frontend and backend components
- Managing and querying relational databases
- Deploying web applications in a production environment
- Collaborating using version control systems like Git and GitHub

Overall, the HBnB project was an excellent opportunity for us to apply our knowledge and skills in a real-world scenario, preparing ourselves for careers in software engineering and web development.
