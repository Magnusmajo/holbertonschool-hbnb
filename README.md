### Model Package

- **models/base_model.py**: Defines the base class for all models in the application.

#### BaseModel

- Initializes a unique ID using UUID and timestamps for creation and updates.
- Contains a save method to update the updated_at timestamp.
- Includes an update method that allows updating multiple attributes based on a dictionary input.
- Has a \_\_repr\_\_ method to return a string representation of the object.

### Amenity:

- Inherits from BaseModel.
- Initializes with a name attribute, which is validated to ensure it is not empty and is less than 50 characters.
- Overrides the __repr__ method to return a string representation specific to the Amenity class.
- Contains a save method that updates the updated_at timestamp, although it seems to contain a placeholder comment for saving the amenity.
